- 👋 Hi, my name is Millie currently working as a community pharmacist for almost 15 years

- 👀 I am interested in using data science and analytics in healthcare to improve the lives of patients

- 🌱 I am currently enrolled in Data Science For All via Correlation One which seeks to train people from underrepresented 
      and minority groups in data science to increase diversity and decrease bias algorithms in data science.
      It is a 14 week program and out of 24,000 peoole who applied only 1,000 were enrolled in my cohort.
      I am also enrolled in the Master of Science in Analytics at Georgia Tech where I have completed classes in 
      Computing for Data Analytics, Introduction to Analytics Modeling and Special Topics in Management/Business Fundamentals and Simulation.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects! I am particularly interested in projects related to healthcare
